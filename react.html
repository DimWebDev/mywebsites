		React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites. But if you’re not familiar with JavaScript or JavaScript libraries, that’s not a helpful definition. So let’s take a step back and deal with those terms first. <br>What is a JavaScript library?<br><br>

		From the definition above, you can see how JavaScript plays a critical role in website and web application development. But there are times when you need JavaScript to perform repetitive functions—things like stock animation effects or autocomplete search bar features. Re-coding these functions every time they occur becomes a “reinventing the wheel” situation. Annnnoying. This is where JavaScript libraries come in.

		JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that can be used for common JS tasks, allowing you to bypass the time intensive (and unnecessary) process of coding by hand. If there’s a run-of-the-mill JavaScript function that you keep needing to code (and that other developers before you have needed for their own projects) there’s probably a JS library to ease your pain. Make sense?

		OK, so let’s get back to React. There are a lot of different JS libraries out there and React JS is one of them—but what makes it unique? What is React JS used for, and why should you learn React JS? And is it better than other JavaScript libraries?
		<br>
		Why Do JavaScript Developers Use React JS?<br>

		React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.
		<br>
		Note: readers often ask “is React JS frontend or backend?” The answer is: definitely frontend. You can keep this straight by remembering the “on screen” aspect of UIs—React is used exclusively for “client side” programming (building things that a user will see on screen in their browser window), which makes React JS a frontend library.
		<br>
		Before React JS, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” (developer speak for the raw JavaScript language on its own) or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development.
